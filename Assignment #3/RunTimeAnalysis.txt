Runtime from fastest to slowest:
Stack Dynamic -> Heap Dynamic -> Static
Stack Dynamic is fastest because it use stack structure to allocate memory in contiguos block so
so the size of array is irrelevant.
while Heap Dynamic allocate memory in random order and have alot of flexibility which make it slower.
static allocate memory before runtime in static manner thus it has to find memory for each element of array
which make it the slowest
